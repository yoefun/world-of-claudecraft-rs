# public/models/props/

Buildings, market stalls, graves, rocks, and other overworld/delve decoration
(`src/render/props.ts`, `src/render/mailbox.ts`, `src/render/delve_props.ts`).

## Size budget

Category average as of this writing: **~72.5 KiB** (83 files,
6,164,317 bytes / 5.879 MiB total). Keep new additions in the 40-100 KB range; a hero landmark
prop (a house, a dungeon entrance) can run larger, but a small standalone
decoration (a gravestone, a crate) should land well under the average. The
procedural Ravenpost mailbox is 32,884 bytes and the Eastbrook noticeboard is
24,684 bytes; older grave/wall/crate additions remain 83-115 KB.

## Compression pipeline

Same `gltf-transform optimize` pipeline as `public/models/creatures/`.
**Always compress with `--compress meshopt`, never `draco`** (see
`public/models/creatures/CLAUDE.md`: this repo's runtime loader has no
`DRACOLoader`, so a Draco GLB silently fails to load and falls back to the old
procedural geometry with no visible error):

```
npx gltf-transform optimize <in>.glb <out>.glb \
  --texture-compress webp --compress meshopt
```

The grave/wall/crate additions landed at 83-115 KB from raw ~15 MB Tripo
exports. Meshopt is less space-efficient than Draco on these meshes,
which is why these land above the category average; iterate `--texture-size`
down first if a future addition needs to land smaller before accepting a size
above budget.

## Naming convention

`snake_case`, named after the object (`mailbox_pillar.glb`,
`cracked_grave.glb`, `destructible_wall.glb`, `fallback_crate.glb`), matching
the existing village/dungeon-kit files (`bell_tower.glb`, `market_stand_1.glb`).

## Wiring

Any file dropped here is picked up automatically by
`node scripts/build_media_manifest.mjs generate` (also runs as part of
`npm run build`); **never hand-edit** `src/render/assets/manifest.generated.ts`.

- Village/overworld structures: `PROP_ASSET_DEFS` in `src/render/props.ts`
  (url + material-dedup `kit` + optional yaw/strip), preloaded in full
  regardless of graphics tier (see the P0 note above `preloadPropKeys`),
  guarded by `tests/render_asset_preload.test.ts`.
- The mailbox pillar (`src/render/mailbox.ts`): `buildMailboxPillar()`
  prefers the deterministic Eastbrook GLB (preloaded via
  `loadGltf()`/`registerPreload()`), binds the shared Eastbrook atlas, and
  falls back to a matching procedural silhouette; either path attaches the
  same "unread mail" votive glow child (`group.userData.mailGlow`, toggled by
  the renderer from `IWorld.mailUnread`).
- The Eastbrook noticeboard (`src/render/noticeboard.ts`) uses the same
  immutable-template and shared-atlas contract, with a two-material
  procedural fallback and tier-independent preload.
- Standalone delve props (`src/render/delve_props.ts`): `STANDALONE_PROP_URL`
  lists the cracked-grave/destructible-wall/fallback-crate GLBs;
  `buildStandaloneGlb()` clones the preloaded scene, normalizes it to the
  prop's original target height via a `Box3` measure/rescale (mirroring how
  `buildGlbChest()` normalizes the dungeon-kit reward chest), and re-seats the
  base on the floor. Each `buildX()` entry point is
  `buildStandaloneGlb(key, targetHeight) ?? buildProceduralX(entityId)`, the
  same GLB-then-procedural-fallback contract the reward/locked chest already
  used. The bell rope (`buildBellRope`) stays procedural-only: it needs two
  distinct pulled/unpulled visual states (rope length, bell tilt, a floor
  glow) that a single static GLB cannot represent without a second wired
  asset or a skeletal rig, so it was left out of this pass; a future PR could
  add a small pulled-state overlay the way the locked chest overlays a ward
  seal on top of its GLB.

- Dungeon/delve door arch (`src/render/door_portal.ts`): `dungeon_door_arch.glb`
  is preloaded via `loadGltf()`/`registerPreload()`, yawed 90 degrees on load
  so its authored opening (which faces local X) frames the procedural portal
  swirl disc (which faces Z), and its cloned geometry/materials are marked
  shared with `markSharedGeometry()`/`markSharedMaterial()` (the procedural
  arch/keystone/plinth/portal already were, since door views never get a pool
  key and the renderer's traverse-and-dispose churn path would otherwise free
  GPU buffers still used by other door instances). `buildDoorBody()` falls back
  to the procedural stone arch on load races; the Nythraxis crypt door stays a
  bespoke invisible click-box either way.
- Marsh-ruin dressing (`src/render/delve_marsh_dressing.ts`, The Drowned
  Litany): `MARSH_ASSET_URL` lists the plank-bridge/shrine-fragment/
  corpse-candle/bell-gallows/sluice-post/dead-tree/reed-cluster GLBs;
  `placeLoadedMarshAsset()` clones the preloaded scene, uniform-rescales it to
  the anchor's `MARSH_ASSET_SCALE` target (height or local-X span, matched to
  the procedural fallback's footprint) via a `Box3` measure, and re-seats the
  base on the floor, mirroring `buildStandaloneGlb()`. The corpse candle's
  flame and the shrine fragment's additive glow stay procedural-only and are
  drawn alongside either the GLB or the fallback body, the same way
  `door_portal.ts` keeps its portal swirl outside the arch's GLB/procedural
  branch.
- Yumi maze braziers and torches (`src/render/yumi_maze.ts`): `brazier_stand`
  and `torch_handle` GLBs are cloned per instance; the team-colored flame mesh
  and its point light stay procedural-only and are re-seated against each
  loaded asset's authored height (the torch handle's re-seat predates this
  pass; the brazier flame was added in the same change).

`tests/render_glb_replacement_assets.test.ts` asserts every preload URL above
resolves to a real, manifested file.
